MStar-WLAN parts list

Notes: C1 must be large, the power provided by the controller isn't always steady. The VR needs to be a switcher, a linear consumes too much power. The voltage regulator below seems to work best of those I tried, it's quite efficient in this application. As shown on the schematic, many parts are only needed if using a WROVER.

The 3.3V solder jumper needs to be bridged. The 5V side is left over from prototyping.

Resistors and caps aren't critical, other than below. 1N4148s are fine for diodes.

Most parts are standard, these are specific:
C1 - United Chemi-Con EGXF250ELL202MJ30S (2000uF/25V, 10mm dia, 30mm long)
VR - OKI-78SR-3.3/1.5-W36-C
8P8C connector - Kobiconn 154-UL6661
J3 - microUSB Hirose ZX62R-B-5P(30)
Case - Hammond RL6105
USB/Serial - FTDI FT231XS-R
Reset - Rohm IMH3AT110
RTC - DS3231(ZS-042 module) Note that the header is installed on the side opposite the battery, so the battery is accessible when the module is soldered in place.
