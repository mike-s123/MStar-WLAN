MStar-WLAN parts list

Notes: C1 must be large, the power provided by the controller isn't always steady. The VR needs to be a switcher, a linear consumes too much power. The voltage regulator below seems to work best of those I tried, it's quite efficient in this application. As shown on the schematic, many parts are only needed if using a WROVER.

Resistors and caps aren't critical, other than below.

Most parts are standard, these are specific:
C1 - United Chemi-Con EGXF250ELL202MJ30S (2000uF/25V, 10mm dia, 30mm long)
D2 - Vishay SB140-E3, due to its low Vf.
VR - OKI-78SR-3.3/1.5-W36-C
VR - STM LDL1117S33R SOT-223-4 (only with ESP32)
6P6C connector - Kobiconn 154-UL6661
J3 - microUSB Hirose ZX62R-B-5P(30) (only with ESP32)
Case - Hammond RL6105
USB/Serial - FTDI FT231XS-R SSOP-20 (only with ESP32)
Reset - Rohm IMH3AT110 SOT-457 (only with ESP32)
RTC - DS3231(ZS-042 module) Note that the header is installed on the side opposite the battery, so the battery is accessible when the module is soldered in place.
MicroSD socket - Hirose DM3BT-DSF-PEJS
TVS - BZW04-26B
