MStar-WLAN parts list

Notes: C1 must be large, the power provided by the controller isn't always steady. The VR needs to be a switcher, a linear consumes too much power. As shown on the schematic, many parts are only needed if using a WROVER.

Most parts are standard, these are specific:
C1 - United Chemi-Con EGXF250ELL202MJ30S (2000uF/25V, 10mm dia, 30mm long)
VR - OKI-78SR-3.3/1.5-W36-C
