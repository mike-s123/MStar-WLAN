Controller definitions - .csv files
===================================
For each controller to be supported, a .csv file of a specific format need to be
placed in the filesystem under the /ctl/ directory. This file defines various registers/coils/strings for the particular controller. Morningstar is _very_ inconsistent between controllers, each is unique. Also, don't trust that the Morningstar Modbus documentation for any controller is accurate, there are lots of errors. The filename starts with a unique model name (currently, PS-PWM and PS-MPPT are used for Prostar (gen3) and Prostar MPPT). 

The .csv file for a PS-MPPT is named:

PS-MPPT.csv     Defines the Modbus registers

In addition to the .csv file, a .png image of the controller should also be placed in the /ctl/ directory. See the existing ones for examples to modify.

File format
--------------------
Fields are comma delimited. 

The first field of each line indicates what data
it defines:

r, Registers
c, Coils
l, Load faults
m, alarMs 
y, arraY faults

Blank lines, and lines not beginning as above are ignored. Lines beginning with letters are reserved, 
so comments should start with a symbol (e.g. ! or #).

Each line must end with a comma, unless there's a final comment.
Comments are optional, and are ignored.
No error checking is done on import, the files are assumed to be correct.
The last line of the file must have a \ as the first character, to indicate end-of-file.
Entries of each type must be sorted - the first item (PDU address, bit number) must be in order.
Line endings may be LF (/n, Linux, MacOS) or CR/LF (/r/n, Windows).


Register entries
--------------------
Example line:
r,19,adc_va_f_shadow,Array Voltage,V,f16,RO,[comment]

r  = this defines a register

19 = Modbus PDU address, zero based, decimal. Note that these match the "PDU Addr" numbers in 
the Morningstar documentation but are in decimal. The PDU Addr is also what's reported when polling via json.

adc_va = variable name as given by Morningstar (HI / LO removed), except the following ones should be standardized (Morningstar is inconsistent). "adc_vb_f_1m", "adc_ib_f_1m", "vb_ref", "T_batt", "adc_va", "adc_ia", "adc_il", "Ahc_daily", "Ahl_daily", "time_ab_daily", "time_fl_daily", "time_eq_daily", "Vb_min_daily", "Vb_max_daily", "adc_vl", "Va_max_daily"


Array Voltage = Description

V = Units, one of 
   "-",    "V",  "A", "C",     "Ah", "kWh", "W",  "d",  "h",   "s",      "%"  ...meaning...
    noUnit, Volt, Amp, Celcius, Ah,   kWh,   Watt, days, hours, seconds, percent

f16 = Datatype, one of
   "none", "f16", "n10", "dn10", "int", "uint", "dint", "bitf", "dbitf", "bcd", "n673", "n1032", "n1800", "r417", "n100", "n79_16", "n989_5", "n96_667", "n139_15", "n66_667", "n316_67", "n96_16"
   
RO = Read-Only. Writeable registers are marked RW.
   
====================

Coil line format
---------------------
Example line:
c,0,EqTrig,Equalize triggered,[comment]

c = this defines a coil
0 = Modbus PDU address
EqTrig = Coil name
Equalize triggered = Coil description

======================

Alarm definition format. Load ("l") and Array ("y") are similar.
---------------------
Example line:
m,0,RTS Open,[comment]

0 = bit number in alarm bitfield
RTS Open = alarm text
